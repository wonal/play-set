                        <h2>How to play Set</h2>
                        <p>
                            There are 81 unique cards in a deck, and the board will start out with 12 cards.
                            Each card has four characteristics:<br />
                            - Color (red, yellow, purple)<br />
                            - Shape (circle, diamond, rectangle)<br />
                            - Shading (solid, hollow, patterned)<br />
                            - Number of shapes (one, three, six)<br />
                            <br />
                            The goal of the game is to make "sets" based on certain criteria.
                            A set is three cards where, for each of the four characteristics (color, shape, shading, number), either:
                            <br />- All cards match in the characteristic
                            <br />- All cards differ in the characteristic<br /><br />
                            This is an example of a set:<br />
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="column">
                                    <img src="/images/one,hollow,red,diamond.png" alt="one,hollow,red,diamond" />
                                </div>
                                <div class="column">
                                    <img src="/images/three,stacked,yellow,diamond.png" alt="three,stacked,yellow,diamond" />
                                </div>
                                <div class="column">
                                    <img src="/images/six,solid,purple,diamond.png" alt="six,solid,purple,diamond" />
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            All three cards differ in color; all have the same shape; all differ in their shading;
                            and all have different numbers of shapes.<br />
                            This would not be a set:<br />
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="column">
                                    <img src="/images/six,solid,red,rectangle.png" alt="six,solid,red,rectangle" />
                                </div>
                                <div class="column">
                                    <img src="/images/six,hollow,yellow,circle.png" alt="six,hollow,yellow,circle" />
                                </div>
                                <div class="column">
                                    <img src="/images/six,stacked,purple,circle.png" alt="six,stacked,purple,circle" />
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            While all cards have the same number of shapes and all cards differ in color and shading, two cards have
                            the same shape but the other has a different shape.<br /><br />
                            Once a set is made, the three cards are removed from the board and replaced with cards from the deck.
                            The goal is to go through the deck and make as many sets as possible.  If a set is not present on the board, three more cards will be added.
