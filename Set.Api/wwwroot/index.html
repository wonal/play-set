            <h2>How to play Set</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of the game is to make "sets" of 3 cards based on certain criteria.  
                There are 81 unique cards in a deck, and the board will start out with 12 cards.
                Each card has four characteristics:<br />
                - color (red, yellow, purple)<br />
                - shape (circle, diamond, rectangle)<br />
                - shading (solid, hollow, patterned)<br />
                - number of shapes (one, three, six)<br />
                <br />
                In order to make a set, you must select 3 cards that either ALL match in one of the 
                four characteristics or that ALL differ in one of the four characteristics.<br/>
                This is an example of a set:<br/>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="/images/one,solid,red,circle.png" alt="one,solid,red,circle" />
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="/images/three,solid,yellow,rectangle.png" alt="three,solid,yellow,rectangle" />
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="/images/six,solid,purple,diamond.png" alt="six,solid,purple,diamond"  />
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br/>
                Because all three cards differ in color, all have the same shading, all differ in their shape, 
                and all have different numbers of shapes.<br/>
                This would not be a set:<br/>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="/images/six,hollow,red,diamond.png" alt="six,hollow,red,diamond"  />
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="/images/six,hollow,yellow,circle.png" alt="six,hollow,yellow,circle"  />
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="/images/six,hollow,purple,circle.png" alt="six,hollow,purple,circle"  />
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br/>
                Because while all cards have the same shading and number and all cards differ in color, two cards have 
                the same shape but the other has a different shape.<br/>
                Once a set is made, the three cards are removed from the board and replaced with cards from the deck.  
                The goal is to go through the deck and make as many sets as possible.  If there is not a set present on the board, 3 more cards will be added.
