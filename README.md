## Play-Set

Copyright (c) 2019 Allison Wong

This will be an ASP.NET Core application based on the card game Set.  

#### Current Features

This is a work in progress and at this point, only a single-player version is implemented.  Game logic follows the [official rules of Set](https://www.setgame.com/file/set-english) with the exception of points and penalty points since there is only single-player mode.      

#### Future Plans

- Timed mode
- Two-player version
- Database integration (high scores)
- React
